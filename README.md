## **Project Desciption**
### **Overview**
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

### **Data Source**
The data was sourced from [analyticsvidhya.com](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)

There are 8523 rows, and 12 columns.
The rows represent 8523 observations, and the columns represent 11 features and 1 target variable.
